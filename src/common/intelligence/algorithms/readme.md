# Algorithms

Algorithms typically require *indicative* evaluations not live data so take data from sources aggregated in a way to allow for fast evaluation

## Rules

Here you can use some new functional language that solves the worlds problems, algorithm code *can break the micro rule* 

Most likely the code in here represents your competitive advantage and all other bit of the ecosystem exist to feed this with data it needs to evolve.
