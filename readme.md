# Services

Right now there is only JSON token and schema for an ecommerce solution but the intent is to not create any formal solution or product but a collcetion of micro-services that can work together.

## The plan

As with client code is split between common and domain centric. Create services that can be run as **one app** or spilt out into **micro-services**.

The common directory serves as a staging area until ideas for service are settled. Inside the domain will be code particular to your domain and the **app** that serves as configuring the **connection layer** to the outside world.
